""" Python script for local testing (compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3)

Usage:
Linux and Mac users:
    From your terminal, run
        python testing_tool.py command_to_run_your_script_or_executable
    Note that command_to_run_your_script_or_executable is read as a list of
    arguments, so you should NOT wrap it with quotation marks.

Examples:
C++, after compilation:
    python testing_tool.py ./my_binary
Python:
    python testing_tool.py python my_code.py
Java, after compilation:
    python testing_tool.py java my_main_class_name

See https://code.google.com/codejam/resources/faq#languages for how we compile
and run your solution in the language of your choice.

Windows users:
    Follow the instructions for Linux and Mac users if you are familiar with
    terminal tools on Windows. Otherwise, please be advised that this script might
    not work with Python 2 (it works with Python 3). In addition, if you cannot
    pass arguments to Python, you will need to modify the "cmd = sys.argv[1:]"
    line below.
